# buJWebApp

Built by Jay Montoya

My first web application 'buJ' built using the Python and Flask framework.
This repository is parallel to "The Flask Mega-Tutorial" by Miguel Grinberg, which can be found here:

I decided to test my wits with webapps this summer and see if its something I'd like to pursue after my degree. 
It's also a cool opportunity for me to start a microblog.
